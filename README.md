# Responsive Banking Website Documentation

## Objective
The objective of this project is to create and design a responsive banking website suitable and catering to developers. The website is built using HTML, CSS (with Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript. The primary goal is to provide a practical learning experience for beginner developers while focusing on creating a visaully appealing and functional banking website.

## Mastery Points
1. **HTML Syntax**: Practice with structuring the web page using semantic HTML tags.
2. **JavaScript Toggle Function**: Utilizing JavaScript to implement toggle functionality for interactive elements such as menus.
3. **Linking HTML and JavaScript**: Connecting HTML elements with JavaScript for dynamic behavior, such as implementing hamburger menu functionality.
4. **CSS Tailwind Button Styling and Font Sizing**: Applying Tailwind CSS utility classes for consistent and visually appealing button styles and font sizing across the application.
5. **Footer Section**: Creating a footer section with responsive design using HTML and CSS.
6. **Working with SVG Tags**: Incorporating SVG tags for scalable and visually appealing graphics within the web page.

## Challenges
1. **Responsiveness on Small and Medium Screens**: Ensuring the website's layout and components adapt effectively to various screen sizes, especially small and medium screens, posed challenges in maintaining consistency and readability. Most of my Component 4 - Getting Started content was jumping on top of the picture.
2. **Aligning Pictures with Text**: Achieving proper alignment between images and text content while maintaining responsiveness across different screen sizes required careful consideration and testing. However, through using the Scrimba tutorials I was able to find a sulotion. 
3. **Following the Prescribed Video Lectures**: Navigating through video lectures and applying learned concepts to the project posed challenges in interpreting and implementing instructions effectively. Some of the HTML elements used seemed unimportant to the code.

## Conclusion
The project was successful in achieving its objective of creating a responsive banking website for the Cache Bank. It provided valuable hands-on experience in HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript, while also highlighting areas for improvement, particularly in CSS Tailwind positioning and responsiveness. Moving forward, additional practice and refinement in these areas will further enhance proficiency and understanding.
